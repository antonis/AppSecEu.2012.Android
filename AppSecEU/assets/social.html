    <h2>Thursday, July 12th at 20:00 &#8211; Conference Cocktail</h2>
    <p>All conference attendees, sponsors and volunteers are invited to the Conference Cocktail at the "Kostis Palamas" building on Thursday, July 12th. The cocktail will start at 8pm.</p>
    <p>The "<a href="http://old.uoa.gr/kkp/all_photo.html">Kostis Palamas</a>" building was built at 1857 and at the time it hosted the universityâ€™s medical and physics labs. Nowadays, it has been renovated and it is used as a cultural center and a meeting point for the university community. It is one of the historical buildings of Athens, with characteristic architecture, design and decorations.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kostis Palamas" is located at 48 Academias str. and the nearest metro station is <a href="http://www.amel.gr/index.php?id=52&amp;no_cache=1&amp;selectedstation=23&amp;L=1&amp;cHash=59d73fcea32e79362674bf1a6fa59533">Panepistimio</a>. To get there from Evangelismos station, you pick the line that goes towards Egaleo. You get off the next stop (Syntagma) and head to the red line platform that goes towards Aghios Antonios. You get off at the next stop, Panepistimio. Use the exit labeled as "Panepistimiou Str (Athens Academy)" to get of the station. Once you exit, head to your left, walking in between of the imposing buildings. Cross the first street you find (Academias str.) and you can find the Kostis Palamas building on your right.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, at that time of the day, a taxi should need approximately 10' to get from Divani Caravel to the Kostis Palamas building. Giving the taxi driver the exact address (48 Academias str.) is more than enough.</p>
