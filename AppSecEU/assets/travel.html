<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>This document consists of two parts.<br />
Part 1 is the essential information about how to get from the airport to the city-center and to the hotel. It also describes how you can get from the hotel to the venue.</p>
<p>Part 2 is more of a travel guide consisting of what we (the committee) think is good bars,clubs,fast-food shops, places e.t.c.<br />
As a whole its a rather lenghty document so you can print part 1 to help you get to your hotel and keep part 2 on your mobile device as a reference.</p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<h3>Around Athens</h3>
<h3>Around Athens</h3>
<p>Athens is a beatufiul and lively city suited for party nightlife as well as for families and relaxed vacation.</p>
<p>It is most lively the weeks between the 1st of July and the 7th of August where its bustling with tourists and most Athenians are still in the city.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing</h3>
<p>For the hungry eye (and camera) there are many things to see and capture.<br />
<a href="http://www.visitgreece.gr/deployedFiles/StaticFiles/Photos/monastiraki_night_photo_Y_Skoulas.jpg"><br />
   <br />
Athens is build on twelve hills, the seven historical are: Acropolis, Areopagus, Hill of Philopappus, Observatory Hill (Muses Hill), Pnyx, Lycabettus, Tourkovounia (Anchesmus), each one has something interesting to see apart from the view.</p>
<p>You should definately visit Acropolis, but be prepared for an uphill walk so either pack sunscreen and water, or do it late in the afternoon (archaeological sites are usually open until sunset).</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/View_of_Athens_from_the_Parthenon_001.jpg">Hill of Philopappus</a> is more of a park overseeing Acropolis, you can visit it on the same day as Acropolis.</p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/Obser.jpg">Observatory Hill (Muses)</a> is near the ancient market and it is nice for a relaxed walk.</p>
<p>Lycabettus features a lift which can take you to the top (its taller than Acropolis hill and slightly more tiring to walk), it features a very nice view and one of the luxurious restaurants of the city <a href="http://www.orizonteslycabettus.gr/gallery">Orizontes</a>, the ideal place for a romantic dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%AF%CE%BF:Areopagus_from_the_Acropolis.jpg">Aeropagus</a> is by far the best, it doesnt feature anything except from the view, but its quiet and you can sit on the rocks and have a -kiosk bought- beer.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnyx">Pnyx</a> is of archaelogical interest since it&#8217;s the ancient parliament.</p>
<p>For all of you who prefer flat ground you can:</p>
<p>-Visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastiraki">Monastiraki</a>, Plaka,Psyri</p>
<p>- Watch a concert/play at the Herodeion (under the acropolis)</p>
<p>- Drink, eat and party at Gazi district (Kerameikos metro Station)</p>
<p>- Visit Kolonaki district for a more VIP experience (and its close to the Venue and the Hotel)</p>
<p>- Visit the Panormou area where there are many good bars.</p>
<p>- Visit Zografou area (its more of a residential area but its very close to the Venue and its the place where most students live and go out)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Coffee places</strong></h3>
<p>Been built on hills Athens has the advantage of allowing you to enjoy your coffee in some very nice places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zepellin. Located at Attico Alsos Galatsiou. Amazing view. We recommend you go there for a coffee especially in the afternoon. To get there you will need either a car or a taxi. You can also take the bus but you will have to walk.</li>
    <li>Menta. At Kifissia city-north suburbs of Athens. You can get there via the Metro line 1 (Piraeus-Kifissia) and walk for about 15 minutes from Kifissia station. (Be advised last train on metro line 1 is at midnight )</li>
    <li>Brazil cafe. On Voukourestiou street- centre of Athens</li>
    <li>42. Kolokotroni street, next to Stadiou Street. Access via the Metro: Panepistimio or Syntagma Station</li>
    <li>Waffle house. Vouligameni city- south suburbs of Athens. To get there you will need tram and bus or a taxi.</li>
    <li>Floral. Located at Eksarchia square-centre of Athens</li>

    <li>Many coffee places in Nea Makri beach- north/east suburbs of Athens. You will probably need a car to get there.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bars &#8211; Taverns</h3>
<p>enough with the pictures and the coffee lets drink and eat!</p>
<h3>Drinks/Bars</h3>
<p>In Athens you can find expensive drinks, mid-price drinks, cheap drinks and ridiculously cheap drinks.</p>
<p>Generally the rule is as everywhere in the world, the most expensive the drink the better your head will be the next day.</p>
<p>For expensive drinks visit the expensive hotel bars, like Grand Bretagne, Hilton, Lecabetus hotel and of course Caravel (which has a roof-pool) you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>For mid-price and/or cheap drinks you can visit the bars around syntagma square and near Kerameikos metro station (Gazi District/Area), you can find a bar suited to your tastes.</p>
<p>For ridiculously cheap drinks grab a beers from one of the many kiosks around the city or  remember the following: Retsina Malamatina and Ouzo they cost 3-6 eyros and a bottle of these is enough.</p>
<h3>Recommended Bars:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A for Athens. One of the best roof bars in town. Enjoy your cocktail overlooking Parthenon. Next to the Metro: Monastiraki Station.</li>
    <li>Gin joint. A fairly new bar in Karitsi Square with a very special concept…Jazz, Swing and other sounds of the 20's &amp; 30's in America and over 65 varieties of Gin. Access via the Metro: Panepistimio or Syntagma Stations</li>

</ul>
<h3>Taverns:</h3>
<p>Around Monastiraki and Plaka you can find many Taverns (The local version of pub I guess), they serve Greek Drinks, wine and food they look mostly the same to me and everything there is fine so I cant recomment a particular one<br />
Greek drinks</p>
<p>You can get a drink of these for a normal price (6-9 eruros in most cases), your choices include mayrodafni, muscat, and savatiano and retsina from widely sold wines and ouzo. metaxa, raki, tsikoudia, tsipouro from widely sold spirits.</p>
<p>Be advised: ouzo, raki, tsikoudia and tsipouro are strong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Clubs</h3>
<h3>Recommended Clubs</h3>
<p>Energy restored, mood set, let's party!</p>
<p>With a quick web search you can find many parties and clubs, so below there are only a handful of the most popular ones.<br />
Since it is summer most of the clubs are located at the south and north suburbs of Athens and ideally near beaches. Therefore you will not find easily a club in the centre of Athens in the middle of the summer.<br />
Some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aqua club. St Andreas Beach-north-east suburbs of Athens</li>
    <li>La Costa. Nea Makri Beach-north/east suburbs of Athens</li>
    <li>Island club- Varkiza (more luxurious club)</li>
    <li>Acanthus bar/club. Located at Asteras Glyfadas Beach-south suburbs of Athens</li>
    <li>Balux cafe. Located at Asteras Glyfadas Beach-south suburbs of Athens</li>
</ul>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>You can find pretty much everything to eat, its not NY where the chinese restaurant is around the corner but fast foods and restaurants are everywhere.</p>
<p>Some recommendations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Vlassis</li>
    <li>Cucina Povera</li>
    <li>Kozi's. Burgers' place in Melissia city- north suburbs of Athens</li>
    <li>Feticcio. Crepes in Glyfada City-south suburbs of Athens.Access via Tram</li>
    <li>Crete. Tavern in Kaningos Square for drinking and eating traditional greek food.</li>
    <li>Kotopoulades. One of the best places for sandwiches filled with ridiculous ammounts of chicken,potatoes etc. You can find it in the western suburbs of Athens (Peristeri, Egaleo, Nikea, Ilion,Kerameikos)</li>
    <li>George's steak house Biftekoupoli. Steak house in Glyfada. (a little expensive though)</li>
    <li>Vromiko In Gazi/Kerameikos its more of  a fast food but its the best medicine for the uneasy head and stomach 
    </li>
</ul>
        <p>Souvlaki, the world-famous greek fast food based on pitta, gyros, kebab, etc. is everywhere and usually quality is above average. Savvas is a popular souvlaki-chain of above quality standard. Stay away from Bairaktaris at Monastirakis (Thanassis is a few meters up the street and one of the best in the city).</p>
        <p><strong>International eats</strong></p>
        <p><strong></strong>Around the center there are many chinese restaurants and hot dog shops, but the most common and the fastest ones by far are the bakery-like shops which sell pies, pizza slices or cold sandwiches (along with the necessary coffee or orange juice to get you started)</p>
        <p>There is a good variety of quality restaurants too and even a couple of vip gourmet ones.</p>
        <p><em>Discclaimer: These are personal recommendations from our committee members, some of which off the beaten track. No  sponsors which means no discount coupons for you but quality guaranteed  </em></p>
        <p>Around Greece</p>
        <p>Well, since you got to Athens, in Summer, it&#8217;s a good opportunity to visit someplace out of the city<br />
        - Visit Delphi ~2.5 hours from Athens<br />
        - Visit the ancient theater of Epidaurus and watch an ancient play (will have to double check if they have a play at that time of the<br />
        year) ~2.5 hours from Athens<br />
        - Visit Nafplion (first capital of Greece and a nice, icturesque town~1.5-2 hours from Athens)<br />
        - Visit the temple of Sounio (~1 hour south from Athens)<br />
        - Visit the islands Hydra, Spetses, Poros. They are close to Athens (approximately 1:30-2:30 hours depending on the island)<br />
        - Visit Parnitha mountain for hiking if you love nature. There are many shelters where you can stay (Bafi, Flabouri) and can provide you with maps and any guides you may need.</p>
        <p>Islands</p>
        <p>- The islands are a whole different story, and again it depends on what you&#8217;re looking for: relaxing, partying, a bit of both, etc and describing life on the islands is out of the scope for this guide.</p>
